# Matching Game
Play a card-matching game in your browser by downloading the HTML and JavaScript files.

Match all twenty-four randomly generated cards into twelve pairs in the fewest number of moves possible. To count as a pair, you must
match both the shape and color. One move is defined as "flipping over" (i.e. clicking on) two different cards. If the two cards you flip over have the same symbol, they will remain flipped over with their symbols visible.
Otherwise, the cards will turn back over.
